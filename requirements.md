to me 
Dear Stephen
 
Thank you for your interest in our Software developer position (advert attached). We are pleased to inform you that you have been shortlisted and you are invited to proceed to the next step in the candidate selection process.
 
We are asking all shortlisted candidates to perform a programming task, described at the bottom of this email and answer a couple of questions. We understand that you are busy with your work and we do not expect you to spend more than 6 hours on this task. When you are done please email us your code and instructions on how to run it, together with your answers to Questions 1 and 2. Please specify the versions of R/Python, libraries and any dependencies employed in your software.
 
The deadline for this task is 5pm Wednesday 17th of May (Sydney time).
 
We look forward to hearing from you.
 
Programming Task:
 
Step 1. Create a database (using sql, postgresql or related environment) and Include TABLE1 from file table1.csv [ID, VAR1-VAR3, OUTCOME] and TABLE2 from table2.csv [ID, VAR4-VAR10] (Tip: ID refers to the patient identifier). The csv files are attached to this email.
 
Step 2. Using R or Python, train a random forest algorithm using VAR1-VAR10 as the predictors and OUTCOME as the outcome. (Tip: Use existing libraries such as the ‘randomForest’ package in R or ‘RandomForestClassifier’ in Python).
 
Step3. Build a Web app in which the user inputs the following values for VAR1-VAR10:
VAR1=45, VAR2=1, VAR3=0, VAR4=L, VAR5=H,  VAR6=L, VAR7=N,  VAR8=N,  VAR9=L,  VAR10=N
and the Web app displays a value which corresponds to the OUTCOME as estimated using the random forest algorithm. For example OUTCOME=1 (with probability=0.7) (Tip: Use existing web frameworks such as R Shiny or Python Flask. For simplicity, use a simple web form which does not include validation of the user inputs).
 
 
Questions:
 
Question 1: Briefly explain how would you develop this workflow using AWS if tables 1 and 2 had over 1 mill records and over 500 columns. How would this higher dimension impact the design of the Web app?
 
Question 2: What would you have to do if you want the application to be HIPAA compliant? (That is compliant with the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
 
Kind regards
Jenny
